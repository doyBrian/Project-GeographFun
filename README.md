# Project-GeographFun
This project's goal is to educate children about geography in a fun and interactive way!

### Overview

In this project, we have created a web learning tool for children of age to learn about other countries in the world.

### Web App Design Notes 

* The game is called GeographFun - a play on the word geography that will target mainly kids between 8-12 yo or students to help them learn geography in a fun, interactive way.

* The first loading page serves as an About page which will explain to parents or teachers who will deploy the app to their kids and/or students what they can expect from our product. It will ensure them that the users will be safe as none of their information will be required or saved except for first name and state they live in to personalize their experience while using the app. It also gives a brief instructions to users what they need to do. A button is available once they acknowledge the contents to proceed to the next page. Also a hyperlink is available on the navbar to proceed to the Intro page.

* As the next page loads, an intro music will autoplay and an entry form asking for the user's name and state they live in. A spinning globe gif accompanies the text and start button is also present once all these information is entered. Again, none of these information will be saved permanently in any way.

* The next page will load a colored map of the world. First a personal greeting will be displayed on top and a live report of number of people using the app currently. The map is SVG (vector graphics) and is therefore interactive and responsive. One click on any of the location in the map will zoom in or out, and also displaying the name of the country. Instructions at the bottom is visible to remind user what actions to perform for the map interaction. A double click on a country will force to load the next page which is the Fun page.

* When a country is double click, it wil re-direct to the Fun page which will have the specific information about the country selected. The name of the country will be displayed boldly on the nav bar, along with the option to return to the previous pages. Icons are also displayed on top for the user to click on to display specific information about the country.

* The icons correspond to specific information about the country which includes: Capital City, Weather, Current Date/Time, Flag, Language, Currency and Games (which will be a future development);

* The user can toggle any of the buttons/icons as needed.

* This project requires the use of new technologies such as use of SVG, Firebase database and Moment.js.

* This project also requires the use of at least 2 API queries. We are using REST Countries, World Weather Online and Currency Converter.

* For future development - incorporate a language translator to translate specific words in a foreign language; add Games for a more interactive experience; include an interactive map of the specific country.
